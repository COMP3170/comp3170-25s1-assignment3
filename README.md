## General requirements

Your scene should be implemented using:
* Anti-aliasing using 4x multisampling.
* Backface culling and Depth Testing should be implemented
* Mipmaps for all textures (with trilinear filtering)
* Gamma correction (with a default gamma of 2.2)

World space should be oriented so that the the j axis (i.e. the y coordinate) points upwards. The directions of the i and k axes can be set as you deem appropriate. For all world-unit calculations, 1 unit in world space should be equal to 1 metre. 

## Debug - Wireframe mode
* Pressing ‘B’ should toggle between filled and wireframe views of all the meshes in the scene. 

## Debug - Normals mode
* Pressing ‘N’ should turn on a debug mode in which all objects are shaded to display their normals in world coordinates (using a normal matrix), where the RGB colour values are equal to the normal coordinates (r,g,b) = (n_x,n_y,n_z).
* Pressing 'V' should return to the usual non-debug mode.

## Debug - UVs mode
* Pressing ‘M’ should turn on a debug mode in which all objects are shaded to display their UVs, where the RGB colour values are equal to the UV coordinates (r,g,b) = (u,v,0). Values outside the (0,1) range should be wrapped using the [mod](https://docs.gl/sl4/mod) operator.
* Pressing 'V' should return to the usual non-debug mode.

## Boat 

The boat model is provided as a Wavefront OBJ file `models/boat.obj`. This includes three submeshes:
* `boat` contains the hull and frame of the boat
* `fan` contains the fan blades at the back of the boat
* `lantern` cotains a lamp mounted near the front of the boat.

Each submesh includes vertex positions, normals and UVs. An example `Boat.java` class has been provided to illustrate how to access this mesh data of one of these sub-meshes using the `Model.java` class provided.

### Mesh
* Extend the `Boat.java` class to draw all three submeshes.
* The boat should initially be drawn at the centre of the map, so that it sits on the water, with part of the hull underneath the surface.

### Normals
* Load the normals from each submesh of the boat and correctly pass them to the shader.

### UVs & Textures

* Texture coordinates (UVs) for the boat are specified in the mesh. You should use these coordinates to texture each part using the `textures/boat.png` texture provided.

### Spinning Fan

* The `fan` submesh should be animated to spin appropriately around its forward axis.

**Note**: As a submesh, the fan's vertices are defined in the same model coordinate frame as the rest of the boat. The centre of the fan is at (0, 1.252717393f, -1.135f) in model coordinates.

### Movement

The boat should be controlled using the WASD keys:
* Holding 'W' and 'S' should cause the boat to move forwards / backwards.
* Holding 'A' and 'D' should cause the boat to turn left / right.

## Height Map

The islands should be generated using the height map image `maps/islands.png`. Each pixel in the image represents the terrain height at a particular point in x/z coordiantes. Height values vary from 0 to 1. A template `HeighMap.java` class has been provided to read the data from this image file.

### Mesh

* Constuct a height map mesh based on this data. The mesh structure should match the examples given in the week 5 lecture.
* Scale the mesh so the terrain is 100m by 100m. The height of the mesh should be scaled so the a height value of 1 corresponds to a terrain height of 50m. 
* **Document**: Illustrate how you construct the height map mesh, including both the vertex positions and index buffer, using a 3x3 example.

### Normals

* Vertex normals should be calculated for each vertex in the mesh, following the method discussed in the week 9 workshop. 
* **Document**: Explain how you calculate the normal for one vertex in your mesh. Provide an appropriate diagram as well as the relevant equations used in the calculation.

### UVs & Textures

* Appropriate vertex UVs should be assigned for each vertex in the mesh.
* One unit of texture space should map to 1m of world space.
* The `terrain-grass.png` texture should be used to colour the mesh.

### Texture blending

* Parts of the terrain below the water level should be textured using the `terrain-sand.png` texture.
* At the water level, there should be a smooth transition from sand to grass.

## Water

### Mesh & Normals

* A flat water mesh should be created as a single quad that covers the entire 100m x 100m terrain, at a height of 20m.
* The mesh should include appropriate normal vectors.
* The mesh should be coloured a suitable shade of cyan (blue-green).

### Transparency

* The water mesh should be semi-transparent, so underwater objects are visible.

### Ripples

* Fragment normals for the water should be calculated in the shader to implement a ripple effect that affect lighting (below). 
* This should be implemented without adjusting vertex positions or normals.
* Ripples should be animated to move at constant speed across the surface of the water.
* **Document**: Explain how this normal is calculated for one fragment. Provide an appropriate diagram as well as the relevant equations used in the calculation.

### Fresnel effect

In real-world physics, surfaces are more reflective when viewed at oblique angles and more transparent when viewed straight on. This effect is described by the [Fresnel equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations), but they are rather complicated. We can simulate a similar effect using the equation:
$$t = \max(0,1 - (\hat{v}.\hat{n}))$$
$v$ is the view direction and $n$ is the fragment normal. 

* Use this equation to linearly interpolate between suitable minimum and maximum alpha values on the water mesh, so it is transparent if you look straight down, but opaque if you look along the surface.

## Lighting

The project should implement day and night modes:
* Pressing the 'M' key should switch between day and night modes.

Each light mode should implement:
* Ambient lighting on all meshes.
* Diffuse lighting on all meshes.
* Specular lighting on the water surface.

Ambient light levels in each mode should be high during the day and low at night.

### Day

In day mode:
* The sky should be blue.
* Ambient light should be high.
* Lighting should use a directional light source based on the position of the sun.
* The source vector for the sun should rotate east-to-west using the ',' and '.' keys.
* **Document**: Explain how the day-time lighting value for a point on the height map is calculated, using the third-person camera. Provide an appropriate diagram as well as the relevant equations used in the calculation.

### Night

In night mode,
* The sky should be black.
* Ambient light should be low (but not zero).
* Lighting should use a point light source based centred at the front of the boat at position FIXME in model coordinates.
* This light should only affect objects in front of the light source. 
* **Document**: Explain how the night-time lighting value for a point on the height map is calculated, using the third-person camera. Provide an appropriate diagram as well as the relevant equations used in the calculation.

## Camera

* The camera is a perspective camera that follows the boat from an external point of view.
* The camera should always face towards the boat’s position in world space and maintain a constant distance from the boat’s origin.
* The arrow keys should control the yaw and pitch of the camera:
    - Pressing left and right should rotate the camera clockwise and anticlockwise around the boat, respectively.
    - Pressing up and down should pitch the camera up and down, to a maximum of plus or minus 90 degrees (i.e straight up or straight down).
* Pressing the 'Page up' and 'Page down' keys should dolly the camera forwards and back (i.e. change the distance of the camera from the boat) between sensible minimum and maximum values. 
* Pressing the ',' (comma) and '.' (period) keys should zoom the camera in and out (i.e. change the field of view of the camera) between sensible minimum and maximum values. 
* Resizing the window should change the aspect of the camera view volume to match.
* Near and far planes should be set so the entire boat is visible, as well as some of the surrounding landscape.
* **Document**: Illustrate how you calculate the position and view volume of the third-person camera.

# Documentation

You should complete the `Report.md` template included in the project. The report should include:
* A completed table indicating the features you have attempted
* An illustration of the scene graph used.
* Responses to each of the documentation requirements for the features described above.
  
Documentation is marked separately from implementation, but should reflect the approach taken in your code. You can attempt documentation questions for features you have not implemented or completed, but should indicate that this is the case.

Documentation should include both diagrams and relevant equations to explain your solution. **Note**: Merely copying images from the lecture notes or other sources will get zero marks (and may be treated academic misconduct).

Document marks will be assigned per-question as:

| Feature | Marks |
|---------|-------|
| Scene graph | 2% |
| Height Map - Mesh | 3% |
| Height Map - Normals | 3% |
| Water - Ripples | 3% |
| Lighting - Sun | 3% |
| Lighting - Headlamp | 3% |
| Cameras - Third-person | 3% |
| **Total** | 20% |
